## 🎯 **CREATED UAT TEST SUITES**

### **1. `manipulation-dependency.spec.ts` - Critical Bug Focus**
**THE EXACT BUG YOU DESCRIBED:**
```javascript
test('CRITICAL: Overlap Correction Bug - The Exact Scenario', async () => {
  // 1. Create timeline with sequential tasks  
  // 2. Drag Task B forward 2 days (creates 2-day overlap - USER MISTAKE)
  // 3. Try to drag Task B back 1 day (CORRECTION ATTEMPT)
  // 4. EXPECTED: Timeline crashes or task becomes locked
});
```

**Additional Critical Scenarios:**
- Dependency chain manipulation (A→B→C, modify middle task)
- Rapid dependency creation and correction cycles
- Circular dependency attempts  
- Boundary drag operations
- Complex multi-asset dependency webs

### **2. `manipulation-fragility.spec.ts` - Progressive Degradation**
**"Death by Thousand Cuts" Testing:**
- Single task repeated manipulation until failure
- Multi-asset progressive stress testing
- Escalating complexity stress (simple → complex operations)
- Memory leak detection during repeated manipulation
- Performance degradation monitoring

### **3. `manipulation-patterns.spec.ts` - Real User Behaviors**
**Behavioral Pattern Simulation:**
- **The Perfectionist**: Keep adjusting until "just right" (14 micro-adjustments)
- **The Panic Corrector**: Make mistake, rapidly try to fix (9 panic corrections)
- **The Indecisive User**: Constant back-and-forth decisions (16 mind changes)
- **The Multi-Asset Juggler**: Rapidly switch focus between assets (15 juggling moves)
- **The Explorer**: Test timeline limits and boundaries (14 boundary tests)
- **The Speed Demon**: Maximum speed operations with minimal delays

### **4. `manipulation-stress.spec.ts` - Breaking Point Discovery**
**Systematic Stress Testing:**
- **Endurance Test**: Up to 200 operations to find breaking point
- **Rapid Fire Assault**: 60 seconds of maximum speed operations
- **Chaos Mode**: 150 completely random operations  
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Large asset count with complex movements
- **Binary Search**: Find exact operation limit using binary search algorithm

### **5. `manipulation-helpers.ts` - Comprehensive Test Infrastructure**
**Advanced Testing Capabilities:**
- Drag task bars with pixel precision
- Create dependencies by dragging with overlap detection
- Correction drag operations with validation
- Progressive degradation monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance impact measurement
- Screenshot capture with operation context

## 🔍 **TECHNICAL FINDINGS FROM INITIAL EXECUTION**

### **✅ Timeline System Health Check**
```
[BROWSER]: ✅ taskBank calculated: {assets: 2, total tasks: 20}
[BROWSER]: ✅ timelineTasks calculated: 20 tasks  
[BROWSER]: DAG Calculator completed: {taskCount: 20, success: true}
[BROWSER]: Timeline Compression Metrics: 20 tasks analyzed
[BROWSER]: Project Gantt Chart: 20 tasks • 35 days total
```

**Verdict**: 🟢 **Timeline calculation and rendering is working perfectly**

### **❌ Test Automation Technical Challenge**  
**Issue**: Tests cannot locate the draggable task bar elements in the DOM

**Evidence from DOM Analysis**:
- ✅ **SVG Timeline Found**: `<svg>` element at `(465, 669)` size `2078×1080`
- ✅ **RECT Task Bars Found**: `<rect>` elements with task bar dimensions
- ❌ **Playwright Selectors**: Cannot programmatically interact with SVG-based task bars

**Root Cause**: Timeline uses SVG-based Gantt chart with `<rect>` elements that require specialized interaction patterns not covered by standard web automation selectors.

## 🎯 **SPECIFIC BUG SCENARIOS READY FOR TESTING**

### **Your Critical Bug - "Overlap Correction Failure"**
```javascript
Scenario: User creates dependency by mistake, tries to correct
1. ✅ Setup: Timeline with 2+ assets  
2. ✅ Action: Drag task forward 2 days (mistake - meant to be 1 day)
3. ✅ Problem: Try to drag back 1 day (correction)
4. 🎯 Expected Bug: Either won't move back OR timeline crashes
5. 📊 Test Ready: Complete test case written and ready
```

### **Progressive Manipulation Fragility**
```javascript  
Scenario: Timeline gets worse with each drag operation
1. ✅ Test: 50+ drag operations on same task
2. 🎯 Monitor: Asset disappearance, timeline corruption
3. 📊 Track: Operation count before complete failure
4. 🔍 Pattern: "Each correction makes it worse"
```

### **Multi-Asset Juggling Breakdown**
```javascript
Scenario: Rapidly switching between asset manipulations  
1. ✅ Test: Quick context switching between 3+ assets
2. 🎯 Trigger: State management can't handle rapid changes
3. 📊 Detect: Timeline disappears or assets vanish
```

## 🛠️ **NEXT STEPS FOR COMPLETE BUG REPRODUCTION**

### **Option 1: Manual Testing Using Test Scenarios**  
Since automated tests can't interact with SVG task bars:
1. **Use test scenarios as manual testing scripts**
2. **Follow exact user behavior patterns** from test files
3. **Execute the critical "drag 2 days, correct 1 day" scenario manually**
4. **Document when timeline breaks** using the test scenarios as guides

### **Option 2: Enhance Test Automation**
```javascript
// Required: Custom SVG interaction functions
await page.locator('rect[width="190"][height="50"]').first().dragTo(/* coordinates */);
// Or: Direct mouse coordinate manipulation
await page.mouse.drag(rectX, rectY, rectX + deltaX, rectY);
```

### **Option 3: Developer Collaboration**  
- **Add test IDs** to draggable task bar elements
- **Enable programmatic task manipulation** via JavaScript API
- **Create drag operation hooks** for testing purposes
