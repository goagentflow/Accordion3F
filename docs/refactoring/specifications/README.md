## Quick Specs (Brief Outlines)

### LocalStorage Structure
```javascript
{
  version: "1.0",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  state: { /* reducer state */ },
  checksum: "abc123"
}
```

### Excel _DATA Sheet Format
```javascript
{
  metadata: {
    version: "1.0",
    exported: "2024-01-15",
    appVersion: "2.0.0"
  },
  timeline: { /* complete state */ }
}
```

### File Size Limits
- Excel export: 10MB warning, 50MB hard limit
- LocalStorage: 5MB per timeline
- Import validation: 50MB max file size

## Notes

- Specifications should be reviewed before implementation
- Update specs if implementation differs
- Keep specs in sync with actual code
- Archive old specs when superseded
