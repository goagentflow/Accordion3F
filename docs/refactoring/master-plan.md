## üèóÔ∏è PHASE 1: Architectural Foundation
**Duration:** Week 1 (4 days after Phase 0)  
**Status:** In Progress (Day 1 Complete)

### Objectives
Refactor the monolithic TimelineBuilder.js into a maintainable, testable architecture using modern React patterns.

### 1.1 Create useTimeline Custom Hook
- [ ] Create new file: `src/hooks/useTimeline.js`
- [ ] Move all timeline-related state logic
- [ ] Expose clean API for components
- [ ] Document all exported functions

### 1.2 Implement useReducer Pattern
- [ ] Define initial state structure:
  ```javascript
  {
    assets: [],
    tasks: [],
    customTasks: [],
    dates: { globalLiveDate, useGlobalDate, assetLiveDates },
    ui: { showInfoBox, editingTaskId },
    history: { past: [], future: [] }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Create reducer with actions:
  - [ ] `INITIALIZE_STATE`
  - [ ] `ADD_ASSET`
  - [ ] `REMOVE_ASSET` 
  - [ ] `UPDATE_ASSET`
  - [ ] `SET_GLOBAL_LIVE_DATE`
  - [ ] `SET_USE_GLOBAL_DATE`
  - [ ] `SET_ASSET_LIVE_DATE`
  - [ ] `ADD_CUSTOM_TASK`
  - [ ] `UPDATE_TASK_DURATION`
  - [ ] `UPDATE_TASK_NAME`
  - [ ] `IMPORT_TIMELINE`
  - [ ] `UNDO`
  - [ ] `REDO`
- [ ] Implement action creators
- [ ] Add validation to reducer

### 1.3 Split TimelineBuilder.js and GanttChart
Target: No file > 400 lines

- [ ] Split `GanttChart.js` into:
  - [ ] `GanttChart.js` - Main container
  - [ ] `GanttTaskRow.js` - Individual task rows (with React.memo)
  - [ ] `GanttHeader.js` - Timeline header
  - [ ] `GanttGrid.js` - Background grid
- [ ] `hooks/useTimeline.js` - State management
- [ ] `services/TimelineCalculator.js` - Date/duration logic
- [ ] `services/DateUtilities.js` - Helper functions
- [ ] `services/StateManager.js` - Undo/redo logic
- [ ] `services/TaskBankManager.js` - Task management

### 1.4 Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove all console.log statements
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions
- [ ] Standardize variable naming (no single letters)
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to constants
- [ ] Create `constants/timeline.js` for:
  - Colors
  - Sizes
  - Limits
  - Default values

### 1.5 Integration Testing Before Switch
- [ ] Create smoke test checklist:
  - [ ] Select assets ‚Üí verify task bank updates
  - [ ] Set global date ‚Üí see Gantt render
  - [ ] Edit task durations ‚Üí verify recalculation
  - [ ] Test undo/redo functionality
  - [ ] Export to Excel ‚Üí verify data integrity

- [ ] Verify no regressions from JS version
- [ ] Document any breaking changes

### Success Criteria
- [ ] TimelineBuilder.js < 400 lines
- [ ] GanttChart split into focused components

## üß™ PHASE 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Duration:** Week 3-4 (5 days)  
**Status:** 90% Complete - BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED ‚úÖ  
**Approach:** Playwright E2E First, Manual Testing Second

### Objectives
Ensure reliability through comprehensive testing with focus on real browser behavior.

### Why Playwright-First Approach?

Traditional unit tests miss real-world bugs that only appear during actual browser interactions:
- **Race conditions** from rapid user actions
- **Event bubbling** issues between nested components
- **Focus management** problems in modals and forms
- **Async timing** conflicts between auto-save and user edits
- **Browser-specific** quirks (especially Safari date inputs)

By running Playwright E2E tests BEFORE manual testing:
1. **Systematic bugs get caught and fixed first**
2. **Manual testers focus on UX quality, not bug hunting**
3. **Time allocated (Day 3) for fixing E2E findings**
4. **Higher confidence in production readiness**

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Business Logic First:** Unlike typical UI-only E2E tests, our strategy prioritizes validating the core business functionality that PMs rely on:
- **Timeline calculations must be accurate** (working days, bank holidays, dependencies)
- **Accordion effect must work perfectly** (duration changes cascade correctly)
- **Data integrity is critical** (Excel round-trip preserves everything)
- **Crash protection actually works** (recovery prompts restore exact state)

**Four-Tier Approach:**
- **Tier 1**: Core PM workflows that must never fail
- **Tier 2**: Data persistence that prevents work loss
- **Tier 3**: Security and performance under load
- **Tier 4**: Edge cases and integration scenarios

**Real Data Testing:** All tests use actual DMGT asset types from the CSV file, not fictional test data, ensuring tests match production usage patterns.

**Expected Coverage:** ~80-100 comprehensive E2E tests focusing on business logic validation, complementing the 97 unit tests for complete coverage.

### 5.1 Unit Tests (Day 1-2) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
