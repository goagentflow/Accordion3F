## üö® RISKS & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| DAG calculation performance degradation | High | Medium | Incremental calculation, caching, performance benchmarking |
| Circular dependencies created by users | Medium | Medium | Validation prevents creation, clear error messages |
| Excel import/export data corruption | High | Low | Extensive validation, fallback to sequential mode |
| Feature flag switching causes instability | High | Low | Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout |
| State migration fails for existing users | High | Low | Multiple migration strategies, rollback capability |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Users find overlap creation too complex | High | Medium | Simple UI, clear tutorials, progressive disclosure |
| Overlaps create more problems than they solve | Medium | Medium | Conservative overlap validation, easy removal |
| Training overhead increases support costs | Medium | High | Self-service documentation, intuitive design |
| Existing users resist new features | Low | Medium | Feature flag allows gradual adoption |

### User Experience Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Drag-to-resize locking frustrates users | High | Medium | Clear visual feedback, easy unlock process |
| Overlap visualization is confusing | Medium | Medium | User testing, iterative design improvement |
| Excel workflow becomes more complex | Medium | Low | Maintain backwards compatibility, optional columns only |

## üîÑ CHANGE LOG & DECISION HISTORY

### Major Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact | Made By |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| [TBD] | Use DAG calculator instead of two-phase approach | Two-phase approach architecturally flawed, DAG is industry standard | Major architecture change | Senior Developer |
| [TBD] | Lock drag-to-resize for dependent tasks | Simplifies user interaction, prevents conflicts | UX change for overlapped tasks | Team |
| [TBD] | Start with Finish-Start dependencies only | Covers 95% of use cases, simplifies implementation | Feature scope reduction | Team |
| [TBD] | Feature flag for gradual rollout | Risk mitigation, allows rollback | Deployment strategy | Team |
| [TBD] | Preserve all existing functionality | Backwards compatibility non-negotiable | Zero breaking changes | Client/Team |

### Document Versions

| Version | Date | Changes | Author |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| 2.0.0 | [TBD] | Complete revision for DAG approach with backwards compatibility | Team |
| 1.0.0 | [TBD] | Initial plan with flawed two-phase approach | Team |

## üéØ FINAL SUCCESS STATEMENT

**This implementation will be considered successful when:**

1. **Existing users experience zero disruption** - All current workflows work identically
2. **Project managers can compress timelines** - 15-day timelines fit into 13-day constraints using overlaps
3. **Feature adoption demonstrates value** - >50% of users try overlaps when needed
4. **System stability is maintained** - No increase in bugs or support requests
5. **Performance remains excellent** - No degradation in speed or responsiveness

The approach is conservative, backwards-compatible, and focused on preserving the investment in existing functionality while adding the critical timeline compression capability needed by project managers.
